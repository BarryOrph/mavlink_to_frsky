A board using a STM32F4 to read data from the Ardupilot using Mavlink protocol and 
convert it into a lightweight data protocol for the FrSky Telemetry RC receiver.

The code is available under the GNU GPL license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt

to build the application requires the following prerequisites.
( You will need to modify the MakeFile to the paths where you have installed these components )

	***C++ compiler for ARM which conforms to the C++11 standard. ***
	(N.B.Only tested on gcc4.7,gcc4.7.1,gcc4.7.2. If you test another compiler please report any issues) 

		https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

			Select gcc4.7

		or
		https://github.com/prattmic/arm-cortex-m4-hardfloat-toolchain

			(You will need to modify the Makefile to enable C++)

		or

		https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain

			(Not tested by me)

--------------------------------------------------------------

You may wish to try the Application first using the stm32f4 Discovery board.
Since some pins are already taken on the Discovery Board a different set of pins is used,
so you will need to modify the "config.hpp" header (https://github.com/kwikius/mavlink_to_frsky/blob/master/config.hpp)
to define MAVLINK_TO_FRSKY_STM32f4_DISCOVERY_BOARD.

See "resources.hpp" (https://github.com/kwikius/mavlink_to_frsky/blob/master/resources.hpp )
for the pins used for each version
